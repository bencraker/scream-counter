# Monsters, Inc. Inspired 'Scream Counter'

**About**  
This project personalises a counter app built during the *Making Websites Interactive* module in the Scrimba Frontend Developer course. Inspired by my love of movies, I modified the counter to reflect a tool that might be used to count screams in the universe of *Monsters, Inc.*.

The brief for the project was to modify the app by:  
- Choosing a title that interests you.  
- Changing the background image.  
- Using a custom font.  
- Modifying the button colours and appearance.  
- Wrapping the HTML elements in a div and setting a max width.  

# Built With
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript
